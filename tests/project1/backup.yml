### Default archiver (pliz). Can be ommited
# archiver:
#   type: pliz

### You can override with 'stdout' archiver
# archiver:
#   type: stdout
#   ext: txt
#   command:
#     - echo
#     - "backup!"

# array of dict structured with keys:
#   - ttl: the time (in days) this backup will be available
#   - min_age: the minimum age (in days) for a backup (determine the frequency)
# example: ttl:30 min_age:15 -> a backup will be perform every 15 days and each one will be kept for 30 days
#           so there will be always a backup aged between 15 and 30 days

backups:
  - ttl: 30
    min_age: 15
  - ttl: 3
    min_age: 1
